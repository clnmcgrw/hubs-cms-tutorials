### Intro

HubSpot Blogs come w/ built-in author and tag archive pages. It's common for these pages to contain very similar or nearly identical content to other blog listing pages. 

### Setting Redirects

The ideal way to disable tag and/or author archive pages on a HubSpot blog is to set up flexible 301 redirects in the domain settings of your HubSpot portal.

```js
const variable = 'something';
function doThings(things) {
  console.log(things);
};
```

### Using HubL Logic

As an alternative to setting redirect patterns, you can use the HubL function `set_response_code` to make the tag or author pages return a 404 (and hence not be indexed by search engines).

```jinja-html
{% if blog_author or topic %}
  {{set_response_code(404)}}
{% endif %}
```

You could also conditionally render a no-index meta tag...

```jinja-html
{% if blog_author or topic %}
  <meta name="robots" content="noindex" />
{% endif %}
```
